i found out that if i must really be good at what i did yesterday
with the project, i have to redo it today on my own with little 
bit of details to show myself how far i can go witht the little 
i have for now 

i think after these personal eveluation  i can conclude that 
am understanding what am learning which has also motivated me to 
get ready for another stage of the lesson.
